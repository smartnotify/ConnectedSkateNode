# ConnectedSkateNode
This is a node.js version of the connected skateboard.
Remember that this is just a work in progress at this stage and it is likely that you will find many, many,
many ways to improve upon this proof of concept.

We used the Intel XDK to create this round of code, but you
can use any tool you want to edit.

The xdk makes it a bit simpler to then interact with the Edison board.
